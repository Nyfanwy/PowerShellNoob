So this is my first post, officially created on 25th July 2021 I know next to nothing about Git, GitHub, HTML, CSS, Jekyll or Markdown. so this is going to be one hell of an endeavour for me to learn all these tools to develop a semi decent looking PowerShell Blog site.

I can confidently say i know an average amount of PowerShell, and so along with learning the skills above I will document solutions I have found/created here all related to PowerShell. I hope individuals will come across these posts in the future and find at least one thing to be somewhat useful!

Below is a screenshot from what the Home page currently looks like
