So this is my first post, officially created on 25th July 2021 I know next to nothing about Git, GitHub, HTML, CSS, Jekyll or Markdown. so this is going to be one hell of an endeavour for me to learn all these tools to develop a semi decent looking PowerShell Blog site.

I can confidently say i know an average amount of PowerShell, and so along with learning the skills above I will document solutions I have found/created here all related to PowerShell. I hope individuals will come across these posts in the future and find at least one thing to be somewhat useful!

Below is a screenshot from what the Home page currently looks like

There are a number of tasks I wish to complete for this site specifically in no particular order. This is just a mix of blog posts as well as changes to the site.
Away from this site, I have other tasks jotted down to learn Git/Github and more.

- Learn to Style the site. CSS/HTML. I am unsure at this time 
- Google Analytics/Ads (gotta get that passive income!)
- "Folders" under the blog section. E.G.
    - Office 365
    - Active Directory
    - Custom Modules
    - etc.
- Dark mode 
- Commenting
